Visit a product page, click "Check stock", and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.

Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element:

<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>

Then replace the productId number with a reference to the external entity: &xxe;

The response should contain "Invalid product ID:" followed by the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
